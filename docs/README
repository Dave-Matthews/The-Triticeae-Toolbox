Purpose
------------
This document is intended to be an introduction and overview of the code used 
in The Hordeum Toolbox. Therefore the ideal reader is one who will be actually
workign with the code and not just using the system. This will describe the inner 
workings of the system and have little to do with the features and how to use 
them from a user standpoint. 

This document can also be thought of as an informal "programmer to programmer" 
document.



Introduction
-----------------
Greetings. I'm Ethan Wilder. I'm one of the two original programmers for the 
THT (The Hordeum Toolbox). I wrote this to you primarily so that you would
not simply get the THT dumped on your lap without knowing really how
to get from function to function.  

You should be aware that there were 2 of us working on this thing. Each of us
has a very different style from the other. This will become obvious as you 
get into the code. 



Programmer Requirements 
(Things that you need to be capable of)
--------------------------------------------------------
I assume you've talked to Julie Dickerson about the project and already and 
have a pretty good understanding of PHP, MYSQL, and Javascript. A basic 
understanding of genetics and/or barley doesn't hurt either.

Be familiar with database normalization and I strongly recommend getting
DB Designer or some equivilent. Our biggest query is an 8 table join. The 
pedigree section also utilizes a lot of subqueries due to their tree structure.

If you are not comfortable with regular expressions then I would recommend 
picking up a book or having a regular expression reference guide handy. We used
them frequently.

This system does use Ajax. If you're not familiar with ajax, don't be intimidated
by the hype, its actually very simple.  I wrote a tutorial at
http://www.ethanwilder.com/projects/ajaxtutorial/ which explains everything and 
includes a complete reference of the XMLHttpRequest object, complete with
code and examples. http://www.tizag.com also has a nice set of tutorials. 

I can't possibly imagine someone being familiar with PHP and not familiar
with HTML, but if for some reason that's you, then just visit 
http://www.w3schools.com

Most of the code is pretty easy to follow and understand. Some of it, like the 
MS Excel Spreadsheet reader, the ajax system, and especially the image generation
system, will require some study before you're able to confidently modify or work
with it. I will do my best to describe those subsystems here.



System Requirements
(Things the system needs in order to function)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
We developed the THT on a test server. Since we're both leaving and haven't moved
the application over, I figured it'd be wise to inform you of what the system requires.

In the main directory, we included phpinfo.php. That runs phpinfo() so you can see the 
sever specifications. 

- PHP version >= 5.2 
        - GD library : this is the library used to do all the image work on the app, so it needs to 
                     be bundled with PHP.   http://www.php.net/image for more details

        - Safe Mode needs to be off. We're using ini_set() to change memory 
                     requirements for the imaging subsystem. 

        - DOM/XML : This needs to be enabled, we use it in the ajax library.

        - Session : This needs to be supported/enabled. By default it is but this is a reminder.
                      NOTE: sessions are passed by cookie, you can try it with URL passing but
                                  you may encouter strange behavior.

- MySQL version >= 5 

NOTE: The system was origianlly coded on a Windows Server. This should not
            effect how the system functions if moved to a Linux Server.



Database Design and Policies
--------------------------------------------
I recommend using DB Designer 4 or some other equivilent program to look at the 
structure of the database in a graphical environment. Staring at the SQL probably 
won't do it. 

I'm not going to talk much about the Database Design here because there's just too much
to discuss. The design we came up with was a result of an existing database design, combined
with the data we were going to receive to store, and the functionality described in the 
specification.

There are approximately 30 tables are linked together. 

Each table follows a format. Some tables deviate because they have to, again 
refer to the graphical representation.

The primary key of each table typically is " 'tablename'_uid "
Each table typically has a unique name field  " 'tablename'_name "

We wrote functions to handle a lot of this for you but its good to be aware of them:
        get_pkey()       -      gets the primary key column name for a given table.
        get_unique_name()       - gets the unique name column name for a given table.
        chk_references()        - gets all of the foreign key column names for the given table.
        etc.... please refer to "includes/common.inc"

Every table also has has a created_on and updated_on fields.  You won't have to 
worry about these fields when you're querying the database because they're automatic.

"created_on" is of the type "timestamp" and is automatically set when an entry is entered into
                the table using the INSERT query.
"updated_on" is of the type "timestamp" and is automatically set whenever an entry is updated
                using the UPDATE query.

These fields are tricky to setup when creating a new table so be aware of that. If you need to 
feel free to use the "SHOW CREATE TABLE line_records" query to see the table creation
string for a common table.



Software Design
-----------------------
The THT is a relational database driven web application. It completely relies on a central 
repository to function. It's no secret that the design is centered around the database. 

The database is a relational database in which the data is combined and cross referenced in
all different kinds of ways. It was concluded that an object oriented design was not going to be
the most efficent. I personally like OO but its just not practical here. 

Instead we took a layered approach. 

                Theme
                -----------
                Function
                ---------------
                Database

We didn't do too much abstracting in this department because we didn't need to. The less code
the better imho. The implementation is a little counter-intuitive but easy to work with after you
get used to it.

The Theme Layer is kept in the "theme/" directory. It's mostly all HTML. We didn't abstract it so
far as to use an actual Theme Engine like SMARTY.  

The Function Layer is embodied by the pages themselves. Think of the Function layer as the 
layer that glues the Theme to the Database. Essentially, that is exactly what the page does.

        Example: view.php - It acts like a template. It gets the user input, calls the database 
                        functions with the user input to get a result, and wraps that result in the 
                        theme. 

Ideally there will be no mysql functions directly inside of a page in the function layer. 

The Database Layer is embodied in the function libraries. These are found in the includes/ 
directory and is basically the core of the system. 






****************************************************************************************************************

                   The rest of the document is an overview of the directory layout.
                              We describe each directory and the files in them.

****************************************************************************************************************

These descriptions are just general descriptions. There is more specific documentation inside
each file.


/ (main directory)
-------------------------

403.php  - 
        This is the forbidden page. It's just a message displaying what's forbidden

advanced_search.php -
        This is probably one of the only functional pages with mysql functions inside
        it. This contains the functionality for advanced searching: searching for a line 
        by phenotype or selecting lines by a haplotype (ABAABA)

index.php -
        Basic page containing a webform, nothing complicated here.

login.php -
        This is actually a remnant page from a previous theme where we did not have 
        the option to login up at the top left. When we got the new theme, we kept this 
        file as an alternative login page. It also provides a page to return to when the user
        logs out. 

phpinfo.php -
        Runs the phpinfo() function. I would recommend deleting this or doing something
        with it that prevents people from viewing it.

search.php -
        This is the return page when someone performs a general search using the orange 
        box on the left. This page will typically display results. It also possesses functionality
        for handling the advanced search IF the forms on advanced_search.php pointed to
        search.php. This extra functionality is not needed, just an option.

view.php -
        This page essentially is the browsing page. If anyone chooses to browse line records, or
        view a line record, dataset, experiment, whatever, this page will show it. This page 
        requires the table and the uid of the row to select OR the unique name.

fromemail.php - 
	Handles links which were sent by mail.
fromcapemail.php -
	Handles cap participant verification.

/dbtest (database directory)
---------------------------------------
This directory is typically not supposed to be viewed by the public. It's used for administration
purposes. It doesn't have any direct purpose with the system. Just tools for you to use.

alterall.php -
        This is quick file I wrote to alter all of the tables in the database and set their created_on
        and updated_on fields so that they would automatically update when they're supposed to. 
        It's tricky setting them up right so this file is a good reference for when you create a new
        table.

backupDB.php -
        Obviously this file makes a complete backup of the database. It executes the command
        mysql_dump and then prompts the user to download. 

        WARNING: The larger the database gets, the more memory this thing takes up. If you
                move the server to linux, you may want to change this file so that it simply dumps
                to another file and doesn't prompt you to download.

deleteTable.php -
        This page will delete all the contents of a particular table. This was used during creation 
        and all links to this page have been removed. It's good to have around incase you ever
        need it but is slightly dangerous.

exportQueryResults.php -
        This page is actually used by the system. It takes a query, executes the query, and then
        dumps the query results to a spreadsheet and prompts the user for download. Fairly useful
        but probably shouldn't be in this directory. (Yea we don't always follow our own rules)

exportTable.php -
        Similar to above but instead of executing a query, it just dumps the entire table into 
        spreadsheet. Also used by the general public.

index.php -
        The dbtest directory allows you to view all the tables in the database and the contents of 
        those tables very quickly. It's a stripped down simplified peek into the database. It's meant
        to be quickand painless. This page is the part that shows you all the tables.

slow.php -
        This page is meant to dump the contents of the slow query log. It's useful for debugging.
        Right now its basically a web command shell. This is a result of the slow query log
        being on windows and moving around all the time. 

viewTable.php -
        This page goes in conjunction with index.php. As index.php allows you to see all the tables
        this file dumps the contents of a particular table. 

myadmin/ - 
        This is a directory inside of dbtest. In here is the application PHPMyAdmin. It's a full
        database administration program, very very useful, allows you to run raw SQL. Great for
        testing.


docs/  (documentation)
---------------------------------
This directory just contains a lot of backups and various documents, such as this readme.


downloadlite/ (downloads)
-------------------------------------
This is a previously written web application that provides a list of files to download to 
the general user and provides a log of the number of times a file is downloaded and who it was
downloaded by. This was specially requested by Julie.


genotyping/ (genotyping related files) 
-----------------------------------------------------

mapdisplay_iframe.php -
        This page will show a particular map and all the markers associated with the map in
        a nice little image file  - complete with image map for marker selection, and functionality
        to move around in the image inside an iframe. It's one of the most complicated files
        that we have.  See the file itself.

marker_selection.php -
        This page allows the user to select a set of markers. The markers selected are stored in
        the session variable  $_SESSION['clicked_buttons'].  

show.php -
        This page will show all the markers associated with a given line record. It shows in table
        format. 


images/ (image generation subsystem)
--------------------------------------------------------
There are a couple images here, the images/ directory just seemed like a good place
to put them. This directory primarily contains all the image drawing functions. 

map_image.php -
        This page is basically the wrapper that draws out the image matrix saved in the session
        variable.

pedi_image_imgmap.inc -
        This file contains all the functions associated with drawing an image map over an image
        that was created. Yes, that's right, we made a GUI framework using raw images and 
        image maps. 

pedi_image.php -
        This file contains the functions associated with drawing the pedigree tree image.


includes/  (the core)
-----------------------------

ajaxlib.php -
        This is probably the only php file in this directory. This file is the library of php functions 
        that are called from ajax routines found in core.js. This is also the ONLY place that
        the ajax functions are called from. 

boostrap.inc -
        This is the loader. This loads all the functionality. It includes all the function libraries, 
        performs XSS/SQL Injection filtration,  word censoring, initial database connection, and 
        a function that will make the page password protected. Every page should include this 
        file and will only need to include this file. 

common.inc -
        This library contains (mostly) all the functions that don't belong to a specific region of 
        the site. For Example, phenotype, pedigree, and genotype functions are stored in their 
        respective libraries. Common functions are found in common.inc.   

        Note: database functions such as get_pkey() are found in this file as well.

core.js -
        This is the core javascript library. All javascript functions are found in here. This is the 
        other half of the ajax subsystem. Typically all the javascript functions need to do is 
        call the php function in ajax library.  See core.js for more details.

error.inc -
        This is a small little library that wraps error messages. Instead of having to type out
        the HTML for an error, you can simply call error(1, $msg).  

        Note: A complicated error handling system was originally going to be made but due 
                to simplicity requirements it was scrapped. 

general.inc -
        Try not to confuse this library with common.inc  Common stores all the common functions
        that are common amongst all the different regions. This library represents a reigion,
        the "other" region.  Browsing functions for example are stored here. The names 
        can be confusing. Essentially the functions that view.php call can be found here.

history.inc -
        Originally the system was going to have a comprehensive breadcrumb history system. 
        I wrote this object at home and brought it here, its possesses all the functionality to restore
        pretty much anything. It's not used as of right now.

image.inc -
        This is part of the image subsystem. This contains the basic framework for the functions
        in the image subsystem. The files in the images/ directory are like wrappers to achieve 
        a specific function using functions in this library.

login.inc -
        A while back I wrote general login. I took that and modified it. This library contains all
        the login functions associated with the THT, including the encryption (sha1) scheme 
        and all functions relating to adding a user, checking good passwords, etc.

marker.inc -
        This is a small library also, this contains functions associated with the genotyping reigion,
        markers and haplotypes.

pedigree.inc -
        This is a big library. This contains functions associated with the pedigree region. 
        Pedigrees are essentially big trees so there's a lot of tree manipulation functions in here.
        
        Note: The tree structure we use is strictly a php array tree implementation. No objects
                are used.

search.inc -
        This library contains the functions associated with general searches. Advanced searches
        are not handled in this library, just general keyword searches.

SpryEffects.js -
        This is a 3rd party library provided by Adobe. This library is responsible for the nifty sliding
        registration form found on the left when a user pushes "register" up by the login.

traits.inc -
        This library contains phenotype related functions, including the biggest query we have. It's
        all actually fairly simple though.


login/ (authenticated pages)
----------------------------------------
All of the pages in this directory utilize the loginTest() function found in bootstrap.inc. That
function will test if a user is logged in, check the login credentials, and determine whether or 
not the user can proceed to view the page.

cleanup_temporary_dir -
        This page deletes all the temporary directories that are created in login/uploads/ when
        a user uploads a file. All of the data input is through Excel files and these need to be 
        uploaded. This is just a cleanup mechanism. 

downloads.php -
        Raw datafiles after being uploaded are moved to the downloadlite/downloads/ directory. 
        This page is basically an extention of downloadlite, this is the page where users can 
        actually download the raw datafiles. Downloadlite also maintains a log of what was 
        downloaded, how many times, and by who.

edit_line.php -
        This page allows the user to edit line records incase any information was incorrect. There 
        is no global edit page yet as one has not been requested. So right now there's edit_line.php
        and edit_traits.php

edit_pedigree.php -
        This is different from edit_line and edit_traits in that we're dealing with pedigrees which
        are more sensitive. (They're part of a tree). So more error checking is taken into
        consideration here.

edit_traits.php -
        Same as edit line except it edits the phenotype definitions, not actual phenotype data.

export_gateway.php -
        This page is a gateway page to all the different methods of getting data out of the system
        into exel spreadsheets. It's the opposite of the import gateway.

general_table_input.php -
        This is a crude method of getting data into the database. You select which table you
        want to insert data into, and then fill out a very basic form. It's crude and not very
        user friendly, but handy if you want to add one new institution or something.

index.php -
        This is the splash page after someone logs in. This pages shows the number of 
        entries each table. The tables are organized by region. The function that organizes 
        the tables by region is hardcoded in search.inc for some reason.

input_gateway.php -
        This page is the opposite of export_gateway.php. Instead of being a gateway to all the
        ways of getting data out of a system. This page is a gateway to all the ways of getting
        data into a system.

markerAdd.php -
        There are some customized ways of adding data. This is one of those pages. This 
        will take a specifically formatted excel file containing marker data and add it to
        the database. This page is redundant due to parser_add.php

parser_add.php -
        This page is a global input page. Any data can be entered this way. It requires a 
        formatted excel document containing the data and another formatted excel document
        called a "definition" that defines what column is what in the data document and 
        where it goes in the database. It's fairly complicated but nice.

pedigreeAdd.php -
        This is a special page that will take formatted pedigree data and add that to the system.
        This also has options of adding a single pedigree or a "pedigree string" to the database. 

store_marker.php -
        This is the back half of markerAdd.php, this is what does the heavy lifting and actually
        adds the data to the database.

store_parser.php -
        Same as store_marker but for parser_add.php

store_pedigree.php and store_traits.php -
        Same as above

str2table.php -
        This is a very special page. It can take a pedigree string, which is a tree in some wacky
        string format, parse it, and put it into the database. Be careful when using this function
        as string parsing is not always perfect. Some people use a modified pedigree string
        format and the resutl will be a mess in the pedigree tree.  If you ever use this page,
        test the pedigree string in "pedigree/parse_pedigree.php" that page will parse the 
        string into a tree format and display it for you.

traitAdd.php -
        Special page for adding traits, not really used anymore.

uploader.php -
        This page is used during the upload process, it actually uploads the file to the server 
        and displays it for the user to see to ensure that the data and parsing is correct

vurvUp. php -
        This was a page that used a relatively complicated update query with a subquery which
        added an id into all the line records. It's mostly just a reference now. 


pedigree/ (pedigrees)
--------------------------------

line_selection.php -
        This page is used for selecting certain lines and putting them inside 
        $_SESSION['selected_lines']

parse_pedigree.php -
        This page will take a formatted pedigree string and parse it into a tree and
        then display that tree. It's a good test to ensure that the pedigree string is formatted
        properly

pedigree_markers.php -
        This page will show the alleles for all selected markers for selected lines. It's basically
        an intersection between the values of $_SESSION['clicked_buttons'] and 
        $_SESSION['selected_lines'].

pedigree_tree.php -
        This page will show the graphical pedigree tree for a given line record.

reerse_pedigree.php -
        Pedigrees are organized by parents. Reverse pedigree is finding all the children of a
        particular parent.

show_pedigree.php -
        This is a wrapper for view.php?table=line_records&uid=x  where x is the line_record_uid
        for a particular line. 


phenotype/ (phenotypes)
------------------------------------

compare.php -
        This page will select lines based on phenotype data. It can narrow down search results
        if $_SESSION['selected_lines'] is filled.

show.php -
        This page shows all the phenotypic data for a particular line record.


theme/ (the theme)
----------------------------

admin_header.php -
        This page contains all of the theme information, including 2 menus, one for when a user
        is logged in and one for when they're not. This is also the only other page where 
        database information, such as host, user, pass, and dbname is hardcoded. bootstrap.inc
        and this page. 

The rest of the files in this directory are all theme related information, css files and old back
 ups. 

securimage/ (captcha support)
------------------------------

Code from http://www.phpcaptcha.org/
